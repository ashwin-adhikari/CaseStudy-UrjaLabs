      \section{Forms of Ownership}
This business operates similarly to a sole trader, where the company's head, often the Chief Executive Officer, is also the owner. This structure means there is little distinction between the owner's personal life and business decisions, making the owner accountable for the company's losses or obligations.

Despite being a sole trader, the business can still engage with other firms, including sibling companies. Sister companies are separate legal entities under the same ownership, commonly through a corporate group. These affiliations can involve various partnerships, such as mergers, strategic alliances, joint ventures, consignment, or franchising. These arrangements allow each entity to maintain its distinct legal and operational identity while cooperating for mutual benefit.

A sole proprietorship can partner with sister companies to share resources, cut costs, expand markets, or develop new products. Each business retains its individual identity but collaborates as part of a larger group. The partnerships vary depending on the relationships between the companies and their specific strategic goals, allowing for diverse forms of cooperation.
