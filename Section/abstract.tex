The pursuit of synthesizing novel images for 3D construction has evolved significantly since the 19th century, aiming to provide users with robust object experiences. This project delves into the realm of 3D image synthesis, exploring two prominent techniques: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting. NeRF utilizes deep learning techniques to synthesize novel views of complex scenes from a sparse set of images, achieving photorealistic results by learning and rendering volumetric scene functions. On the other hand, Gaussian Splatting is a point-based rendering technique that converts 3D point clouds into visually continuous surfaces using Gaussian kernels. Our investigation aims to delineate the theoretical frameworks, practical implementations and to develop interactive environment to facilitate the understanding of these complex concepts. The output is expected to be in video format for NeRF and interactive point cloud and photos for Gaussian Splatting.\\
